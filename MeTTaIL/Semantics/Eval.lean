Module: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Eval
Layer: Semantics
Purpose: The fuel-bounded normalizer that turns the one-step reducer into a runtime. `eval` applies
  `oneStep` until no step applies or the fuel runs out; it is total, with no `partial`. The headline is
  `eval_sound`: the normalizer's result is always reachable from the input by many context rewrites,
  so every run is a genuine reduction sequence of the presentation. `eval_fixed_of_normal` records that
  a normal term is a fixpoint. Detecting "stopped because normal rather than out of fuel" is decidable
  via `IsNormal` (whether `oneStep` of the result is `none`); a full completeness statement (that
  reaching `none` means no reduction exists) is strategy-dependent and deferred to the confluence and
  strategy stage.
Imports: MeTTaIL.Semantics.Context
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: RewStepMany, RewStepMany.single, RewStepMany.trans, eval, IsNormal, eval_sound,
  eval_fixed_of_normal
Open obligations: completeness (that the normalizer finds a normal form whenever one exists) needs a
  normalizing strategy (parallel-outermost) and is future work.
