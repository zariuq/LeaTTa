Module: MeTTaILProofs.ConditionalCP
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: Confluence of the PREMISED (conditional) rewrite fragment, the part the unconditional Critical
  Pair Theorem (`CriticalPairs`) does not reach. A presentation's premised rewrites (the congruence/context
  rules par1, par2, RNew, and genuine side-conditioned rules) form an oriented conditional term rewrite
  system. Following the standard theory (Avenhaus-Loria-Saenz 1994; Dershowitz-Okada-Sivakumar 1987; Lucas,
  JLAMP 2024), this module:
    * models a conditional rule and the STRATIFIED oriented conditional rewrite relation `CRstep` (a rule
      fires when its left side matches and each condition `s ~> t` holds at a strictly lower level; the
      level keeps the definition well founded, the route to level-confluence in the literature),
    * proves the structural facts (level monotonicity, context congruence, the conditional Parallel Moves
      Lemma) directly, since a rule's conditions are about its own substitution and are untouched by a
      rewrite at a parallel or surrounding position,
    * proves the conditional Critical Pair Lemma soundness direction `c_localConfluent_of_joins`: a system
      whose conditional critical pairs (`CCPJ`) and conditional variable pairs (`CVarJ`) are joinable is
      locally confluent. These are exactly the two joinability obligations of Lucas Theorem 43 (the
      EXTENDED conditional critical pairs = proper critical pairs together with the conditional variable
      pairs), supplied here as hypotheses just as the unconditional `CPJ` is in `CriticalPairs`,
    * chains it with Newman's lemma for the headline `c_confluent_of_joins`: a terminating conditional
      system whose extended conditional critical pairs are joinable is confluent.
  This is the soundness ("if") direction; deciding the conditional critical pairs by conditional narrowing
  is out of scope, as the unconditional `CPJ` decision is in `CriticalPairs`. The position algebra and the
  substitution lemmas are reused verbatim from `CriticalPairs` (they are relation-independent).
Imports: MeTTaILProofs.CriticalPairs (FOTerm, positions, subAt/repAt/subst, the position algebra, Newman)
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: CRule, CRstepN, CRstep, CRstepN_mono, crstep_context, crstep_parallel_join, CCPJ, CVarJ,
  c_localConfluent_of_joins, c_confluent_of_joins
Open obligations: deciding the conditional critical pairs (conditional narrowing) to discharge `CCPJ`/`CVarJ`
  automatically is future work, as is the completeness ("only if") direction.

/-- A conditional rewrite rule: a left side, a right side, and a list of oriented conditions `(s, t)`, each
    read as `s` reduces to `t`. A presentation's premised rewrite `let s ~> t in lhs ~> rhs` is a rule of
    this shape; a premise-free rule has `conds = []`. -/

/-- The stratified oriented conditional rewrite relation at level `n`. A rule fires at level `n+1` when its
    left side matches at some position under a substitution `σ` and each condition `s ~> t` holds, read as a
    reduction `subst σ s ~>* subst σ t` at the strictly lower level `n`. Level `0` is empty. Stratifying by
    level keeps the recursion well founded (conditions are checked with fewer levels available) and is the
    standard device behind level-confluence of conditional systems. -/

/-! ### Level monotonicity

More levels only allow more steps. This lets two steps that fire at different levels be brought to a common
level, and lets the conditional relation be treated as a single relation. -/

/-! ### Context congruence

A conditional rewrite inside any context is again a conditional rewrite at the SAME level, because the
rule's conditions concern its own substitution and are unaffected by the surrounding context. From this the
whole reduce-inside-a-context toolkit lifts to the conditional relation. -/

/-! ### Bounding the level of a reduction, and firing a rule

A finite reduction sequence (and a rule's finite list of conditions) only uses finitely many levels, so a
common bound exists. This lets a rule with conditions be fired as a single conditional step, working with
`CRstep` and `ReflTransGen (CRstep R)` directly rather than juggling explicit levels. -/

/-! ### The conditional critical pair theorem (soundness, Lucas Theorem 43)

The two joinability obligations are the EXTENDED conditional critical pairs: the proper conditional critical
pairs `CCPJ` (non-variable overlaps of two rules, joinable WHEN both rules' conditions hold) and the
conditional variable pairs `CVarJ` (an inner redex inside the image of a variable of an outer rule). They
are supplied as hypotheses, exactly as the unconditional `CPJ` is in `CriticalPairs`. -/

/-- Conditional critical pairs joinable: every non-variable overlap of two rules, when both rules'
    conditions hold, gives a joinable peak (the proper conditional critical pairs). -/
def CCPJ (R : List CRule) : Prop :=

    Joinable (CRstep R) (subst θ1 rule1.rhs) (repAt (subst θ1 rule1.lhs) o (subst θ2 rule2.rhs))

/-- Conditional variable pairs joinable: an inner redex inside the image of a variable `x` of an outer
    rule, at position `ov ++ q`, gives a joinable peak when both rules' conditions hold. This is the
    conditional variable-pair obligation; for left-linear systems it is discharged by reduce-all-copies. -/
