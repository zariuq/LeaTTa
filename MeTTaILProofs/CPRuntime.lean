Module: MeTTaILProofs.CPRuntime
Layer: Proofs
Purpose: Connect the first-order Critical Pair Theorem (`CriticalPairs`, over `FOTerm`) to the actual
  runtime relation `RewStep` over `AST`. A faithful embedding `emb : FOTerm → AST` (variables named by an
  injective `ν`, applications as `sexp`) is shown to simulate the FOTerm rewrite relation `Rstep` by the
  runtime's `RewStep` on the embedded (subst-free) fragment. The embedding commutes with substitution and
  with positions, the root case uses the matcher correctness of `MatcherCorrect` (a successful `matchPat` is
  exactly a rule instance), and the congruence case lines up `RewStep.arg` with descent into an argument
  position. This certifies that the rewriting the CPT reasons about is exactly what the runtime does.
Imports: MeTTaILProofs.CriticalPairs (FOTerm, Rstep, positions), MeTTaILProofs.MatcherCorrect (matcher
  correctness), MeTTaIL.Semantics.Context (RewStep), MeTTaIL.Semantics.Relation (Reduces)
Trusted boundary: none (fully proved)
Main exports: emb, emb_injective, emb_subst, emb_subAt, Rstep_to_RewStep (forward simulation)
Open obligations: premised (conditional) rewrites are out of scope, as is the `Subst`/binder fragment.

/-! ### Backward simulation: a runtime step on an embedded term comes from a first-order step.

The forward direction shows the first-order rewriting embeds into the runtime. For confluence transport we
also need the converse on the embedded fragment: every `RewStep` out of `emb s` lands on another embedded
term `emb s'` and is witnessed by a first-order `Rstep s s'`. The crux is `emb_inst_inv`, which lifts an
AST-level match back to a first-order substitution. Because `emb` is injective it has a left inverse, and
the substitution read off the bindings through that inverse is global (one function of the bindings), so the
two argument-list halves never need their substitutions reconciled. -/

/-- The first-order substitution read off a runtime binding list through the left inverse of `emb`. Only
    used in proofs (noncomputable), so the left inverse via choice is harmless. -/

The bridge is parameterized by any injective naming `ν`. To witness that it is not vacuous, here is a
concrete injective naming and the projection system `f(x) -> x` (the same `projSys` whose first-order local
confluence is proved in `CriticalPairs`), with a genuine runtime step obtained from a first-order one. -/
